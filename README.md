## A WIP level editor/game engine for the Nintendo 64

### Setup

Open the editor solution file in Visual Studio 2017 and hit build. That's it! Make sure to also install OpenAL so you can test your rom out in the cen64 emulator included. I've included it in Editor/deps. Also if you so happen to have the excellent 64drive you can test on that too!

### Notes

UltraEd isn't finished and is not a fully polished tool yet. It has enough functionality to throw a few models in a scene, texture them, script them and have some fun. I have many ideas and things I'm excited to implement in the future. Unfortunately, I have a full-time job and other life commitments so I work on this tool in my free time. I love the N64! :0)

### Donations

If you would like... you can donate to UltraEd's development! Give any amount. Even $0.00 lol! ^_^
